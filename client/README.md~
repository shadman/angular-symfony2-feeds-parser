Angular Client Side App.

/app/index.html (Home Page)

As our Symfony API services supports cross origin requests (CORS) as well so you may update services API URL after deploying APIs into PHP directory.

File: client/app/scripts/controllers/main.js
Line 14:

	    var service_url = "http://localhost/feeds/services/web/app_dev.php/feeds?feed_url=";



Web Page is very simple you only need to paste your desired URL into text box and press GO button to parse. As our services supports both XML and JSON so you may use both urls to parse.

Example:

XML: http://pf.tradetracker.net/?aid=1&type=xml&encoding=utf-8&fid=251713&categoryType=2&additionalType=2&limit=10
JSON: http://pf.tradetracker.net/?aid=1&type=json&encoding=utf-8&fid=251713&categoryType=2&additionalType=2&limit=10
